Location Examples for Stack Overflow Documentation
=============================

A collection of sample applications demonstrating how to use the different location stacks on Android.

Note: Many of these examples will be affected by Android Oreo. The main thing to consider for all these examples is that location updates will be limited unless the app is running in the foreground as defined in [Background Location Limits](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/oreo/background-location-limits.html).

PathSense TruePath Location Example
=============================

This example shows how to use Pathsense's TruePath library to obtain map matched location points, even in dense urban areas. This example is a much simpler
version that just prints out some location information rather than display the points on a map. To see the full example, check out their [GitHub repo](https://github.com/pathsense/pathsense-samples-android/tree/master/pathsense-invehiclelocationdemo-app).
